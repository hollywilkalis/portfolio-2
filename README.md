# Holly Wilkalis Portfolio

#### This project is for the last week of the Epicodus CSS section. It is the beginning of a portfolio site. When complete, I anticipate that it will have four pages: home, resume, project gallery, and a page with resources for beginning coders.

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description

When complete, the site will have a gallery for projects with a card for each showing a screenshot and a link to the gh-pages version for each. It will also have a resume page, which I tentatively intend to build using some of the collapsible and modal features of Materialize. The resources page will be a place to share useful resources I've found so far in my coding adventures. Down the road, I may add a coding blog as well.
